# AI workshop
All instructions for the workshop can be found in the ai_biodiv_tutorial file. You can open it either as a jupyter notebook or as a html file in your browser (download file first). To run the tutorial you will need python and preferably also conda installed. Follow instructions below to install.

## Installing and setting up Python

Here are a few steps of preparations to make sure you will all be able to run Python on your personal computers and install any required packages. If you already have a working Python editor setup on your computer, just ignore these instructions.

1. Please install **minconda** on your computer (unless you already have some conda version installed): https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
2. Once installed you will be able to run the conda installation manager through your command line to install software with conda (see `conda install` commands below). Mac and Linux users can just use the native **Terminal** app, but Windows users need to make sure to use the **conda command prompt** that should install together with miniconda. If you as a Windows user can't find the conda command prompt or it didn't install for some reason, you can download anaconda instead (https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
3. Now it's time to install some Python editor. You can choose to either work inside a **jupyter notebook** or within a **Python editor** (similar to R-Studio). Don't worry if you don't know at this point what either of these are, but install one of them. I recommend a Python editor for a better learning effect.

*Jupyter notebook:*
- conda install jupyter
- alternatively you can download Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com) and install the jupyter plugin (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks)

*Python studio editor:*
- conda install spyder
- alternatively you can download PyCharm (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
