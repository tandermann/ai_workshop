# AI workshop
All instructions for the workshop, including installation instructions can be found in the [`ai_biodiv_tutorial.ipynb` file](./ai_biodiv_tutorial.ipynb). You can open it either as a jupyter notebook or as a html file in your browser (in the latter case, download the [`ai_biodiv_tutorial.html` file](./ai_biodiv_tutorial.html) to your local machine first).
