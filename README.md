All instructions for the workshop, including installation instructions can be found in the `ai_biodiv_tutorial.ipynb` file (just click on [this link](./ai_biodiv_tutorial.ipynb)). In case your browser does not support viewing the file in the notebook format, you can instead view the tutorial as a html file. In that case, download the [`ai_biodiv_tutorial.html` file](./ai_biodiv_tutorial.html) to your local machine and then open it in your favorite html-viewer or browser.
